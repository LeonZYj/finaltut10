i have chosen to do only 2 projects becuase 
i was alawys use to 3 including service (logic), api and database entitites
but since here the models are created by itself i leave them in logipart 
and dont move them and i just stick with logpart where i keep models and in api
where everyhting is done, also i did not have enough time to manage it well
i would say personally the 4 projects are perfect where we have service repository webapi and entitites
but i still did not manage to do it well and it is sometimes confusing what to inject where especially in the api
when we do the builder part in the program.cs
