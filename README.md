i have chosen to do only 2 projects becuase 
i was alawys use to 3 including service (logic), api and database entitites
but since here the models are created by itself i leave them in logipart 
and dont move them and i just stick with logpart where i keep models and in api
where everyhting is done, also i did not have enough time to manage it well
i would say personally the 4 projects are perfect where we have service repository webapi and entitites
but i still did not manage to do it well and it is sometimes confusing what to inject where especially in the api
when we do the builder part in the program.cs



The connection string has info to connect to a database: 
where it is, which database to use, login details, and a setting 
to trust the connection. It helps the app talk to the database.
